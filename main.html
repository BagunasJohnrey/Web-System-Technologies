            <p>In your home, chances are there are several points people could enter your house from—front doors, back doors, garage doors, windows, and so on—however, your guests probably enter your home from one point more times than all of the others combined. <br> That’s how the homepage of your website works, as well—there are several entry points and pages on your website, but more times than not, users find your homepage first. <br>That’s why on a typical website, the homepage has the most traffic and links pointing to it. That’s because your homepage is the oldest URL on your website, your homepage typically has the most direct visits, and homepages are the most advertised URL for online and offline marketing channels.,<br>In this blog post, we'll dive a little deeper on how (and why) to keep your homepage updated and optimized.</p>

            <h3>The Purpose of Optimizing Your Homepage</h3>
            <p>Overall, the purpose of your website is to market your products or services and turn website visitors into leads and, eventually, customers—and your homepage is no different. It should be easy to navigate, easy to understand, and offers your personas information on what they are searching for.In essence, your homepage should answer the question, “Can I help you find what you’re looking for?” You want to help the visitor get from your homepage to page two, because then, they’ve expressed what they are interested in knowing more about.</p>

                    <h4>State Your Value Proposition</h4>
                    <ul><li>What is this product or service?</li></ul>
                    <ul><li>When I'm on this website, where should I go first?</li></ul>
                    <ul><li>Does the website help solve any problems for me?</li></ul>
                    <ul><li>Why should I choose this product/service over any others to solve my problems?</li></ul>
                </li>

                <li>

                    <ul><li>Adjust the content of your website to be more personalized and relevant</li></ul>
                </li>

                <li>

                    <ul><li>Adjust the content of your website to be more personalized and relevant</li></ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Calls to Action</h4>
                    <p>Help move website visitors down the funnel in their buying process with the following CTAs:</p>
                    <ul><li>
                        <strong>Awareness CTAs:</strong> These calls to action should link to a landing page offering a piece of content that helps your website visitor gain more information on a certain topic.</li></ul>
                    <ul><li>
                        <strong>Consideration CTAs:</strong> These CTAs generally link to pieces of content that help solve problems that your website visitors have already defined.</li></ul>
